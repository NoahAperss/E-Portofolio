          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>  My name is Noah Apers, I am a student of Thomas More Geel in the direction of application development. Since I was a child I was interested in the computer world, it just felt natural to choose this direction. After 2 years I am sure that I made the right choice and I will become a very good developer! In the 2nd year of my major, I had to choose what I wanted to major in. I chose application development. I like working with code and can immerse myself in this as well. </p>

          <h2>Projects/realisations</h2>
          <p>In the years I've been studying IT, I've created all kinds of projects. In this section I am going to show a couple of them. </p>

              For the subject requirement analysis, I had to perform the analysis phase of an application with a group of fellow students. For this we first had to ask questions to the customer so that we had as much information as possible and could make an application that meets the requirements of the customer. We created an ERD with accompanying use cases and prototypes. My role throughout this project was just about everything. The tasks were well distributed among the team and everyone did get to do something of everything. The goal of this project was to make a good analysis that we can use afterwards to effectively make the application in PHP. After carrying out this project, I learned a lot, it was a good experience!

                When I was still taking IT in KDG, I had to make a game for the JavaFX subject. We had to make a game in the MVP ( model view presenter ) concept. This was normally a group work with 2, but my partner had dropped out without participating in the project. Despite this setback, the project came to a good end. I made a working game with a point system, high scores, and so on. The game I made was 2048, the goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number on it. Once a tile is combined it adds up the numbers. So for example if you combine 2 tiles with the number 4, the two tiles wil become one with the number 8. When you hit a tile with the number 2048 you won the game but you'll also have the oppurtunity to keep going to get the highest score.  After making this project, I became completely enthralled with Java and my Java level also increased. My mindset as a programmer has progressed a lot. As a result, I got much better grades in the future because I got the basic principle of programming by making this project!

                During the requirements analysis project, we made the preparations for the PHP project. For this project, we used the data model we created in the previous project. We also have the same group.
                We had a lot of conversations with our client ( who is one of our teachers ) and we were told to create a care program for the school. The program has to be able to create a student file with all kinds of data that has to be stored here and it also has to be very flexible so the user of the program can easily change all kinds of data. Every student that is registered in the program has a kind of "disability". So these students require some facilities like extra time. This data is assigned to a person's student file and can be retrieved by teachers. For this project we use Trello and all our tasks are in a list, we just choose which task we want to complete. I created some CRUD operations and they took the hosting of the project on me. For the hosting I used Combell. This was the first time I used this service but I liked how the process of hosting the project worked and I learned a lot by doing so. In general, this project made us work as a team on a big project and we all learned a lot. This was a very good experience.

                Last year at project week, I had chosen project networking. We had to develop a network in a group with all kinds of requirements in terms of subnets and which devices should be where. The goal of this project was to get cameras working so that you could go and look at the live images of the camera at any time. For this project, I took on the task of configuring the network devices. It took a long time until everything worked perfectly but I managed to get everything done. This project has made me realize that you have to keep going even if something fails and it has also had a positive impact on my perseverance.
