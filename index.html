          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Noah Apers, and I am currently a student at Thomas More Geel, pursuing a degree in Application Development. My fascination with the world of computers started from a very young age, and it seemed only natural for me to follow my passion in this field. As I delved deeper into the world of technology and programming, I became more and more confident that I had made the right choice by pursuing a career in this domain. Now, after two years of immersive and hands-on learning experiences, I am certain that I am on the right path to becoming an exceptional developer in the near future.</p>

              <h3>Future</h3>
              <p>In the initial stages of my professional journey, I envision myself embarking on a career as a .NET backend developer. This area of expertise not only aligns with my current skill set, but also presents an exciting opportunity for me to further explore the vast landscape of software development, while making meaningful contributions to the industry.</p>
              <p>However, I firmly believe that continuous learning and professional growth are essential components of a successful career in the ever-evolving field of technology. With this in mind, I aspire to expand my knowledge and gain experience in various other domains as I progress in my career. These areas include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing data models, diving deeper into the realm of artificial intelligence, and familiarizing myself with cutting-edge technologies and techniques that are shaping the future of software development.</p>

          <h2>Stage Elmos</h2>

          <p>In the past three months, I have been working as an intern at Elmos NV, a well-established and reputable company in the field of IT consultancy. My primary responsibility during this internship has been to contribute to the development of a cutting-edge application that collects and consolidates social media data from various sources, ultimately presenting it in the form of accessible, user-friendly dashboards. While there are already existing applications that serve a similar purpose, our aim is to offer a more cost-effective solution, ensuring that our clients are not burdened with exorbitant monthly fees, such as the $1,000 that other services may charge.</p>

          <p><b>Technologies and My Role</b></p>
          <p>In order to facilitate this process, we have chosen to store the gathered social media data in a BigQuery database. This approach allows for seamless integration with Power BI, empowering our clients to create their own customized dashboards, which can offer even more detailed and specific insights. To accomplish our objectives, we have divided the project into four distinct components: one frontend and three interconnected backends, each responsible for a different aspect of the process. During my time at Elmos NV, I have been primarily involved in the development of the authentication backend.</p>

          <p><b>Learning and Contributions</b></p>
          <p>This has allowed me to learn numerous new concepts and skills, such as devising a workflow for connecting our application's users to their LinkedIn accounts through OAuth. Additionally, I have been responsible for creating a secure route that only our other backends can access, incorporating a signature into the route and ensuring that it is only accessible with the correct key and header. The authentication backend also required me to develop a comprehensive user/organization and JWT system, including the implementation of roles, statuses, and other related features. Aside from my work on the backend, I have also contributed to the creation of data models by participating in brainstorming sessions and group meetings.</p>

          <p><b>Agile Methodology and Communication</b></p>
          <p>Throughout the duration of this project, our team has adopted an agile methodology, working within the framework of sprints and completing assigned tasks within specified timeframes. We have maintained regular communication through daily meetings at 10 AM via Microsoft Teams, ensuring that we stay aligned and focused on our objectives.</p>

                <p class="card-text">For our project in the course Professional Skills / Project 4.0, we, a group of five students, were tasked with creating an application. Initially, we had a 2-3 month period allocated for conducting market analysis, identifying the most suitable programming languages to use, among other tasks. Following this phase, we had a three-week span during which we were expected to deliver at least a proof of concept.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Our project involved extracting data from a digital meter and displaying it on a user-friendly dashboard. Your contribution to this project was developing the backend of our application. It was the first time you had ever singlehandedly written a backend, and through this experience, you discovered your passion for programming. Backend development really suits you, and you see yourself progressing further in this field.</p>

To achieve this, we engaged in extensive questioning and elicitation techniques to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the customer's needs and expectations.</p>
                <p class="card-text">As a team, we meticulously crafted an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) accompanied by well-defined use cases and prototypes. These artifacts served as crucial tools in visualizing the application's structure and functionalities, providing a solid foundation for our subsequent development work.

                <p class="card-text">During my time studying IT at KDG, I had an interesting project for the JavaFX subject where I had to create a game. The game was to be developed using the MVP (Model View Presenter) concept. Normally, it was a group assignment for two people, but unfortunately, my partner dropped out without contributing to the project.</p>
                <p class="card-text">For my game, I chose to create a version of the popular puzzle game called 2048. The objective of the game was to combine tiles with the same numbers on them. Whenever two tiles with the number 4, for example, were combined, they would merge to form a single tile with the number 8. The ultimate goal was to reach a tile with the number 2048 to win the game, but players could continue playing to achieve the highest possible score.</p>

The program aimed to facilitate the creation of comprehensive student profiles, housing various types of data that needed to be stored securely.

                <p class="card-text">Two years ago, during our project week, I made the decision to participate in a networking project. This project involved collaborating with a group of peers to develop a functional network infrastructure that met specific requirements in terms of subnets and device placement. Our main objective was to establish a network capable of enabling live camera streaming, allowing users to view camera footage at any given time.</p>
                <p class="card-text">In this project, I took on the responsibility of configuring the network devices. It was a challenging task that demanded careful attention to detail and patience. I encountered several obstacles along the way, and it took a considerable amount of time and effort to ensure everything worked seamlessly. However, through persistence and determination, I successfully accomplished the task at hand.</p>
